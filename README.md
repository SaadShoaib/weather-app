# weather-app

A weather-app that tells the temperature, feels like temperature, pressure, and humidity of your favorite place. 
You can enter a location in the search bar and it'll display the results.

I had to use Open Weather API for this. There was also other data available from the API, but I decided to keep it minimalist.
